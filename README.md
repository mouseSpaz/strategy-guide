## Introduction
The *Kitfoxes Strategy Guide* is an attempt to create a complete breakdown of the fundamental concepts required to develop a successful competitive CS:GO team. The ideas and concepts are based on over a decade of first-hand experience at all amateur levels of the game.

The basic strategy guide will always be open-source, however I encourage others to fork it and make it their own.
